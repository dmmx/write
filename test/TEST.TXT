          There was a program for the Atari XL that divided the screen
          up into row with a little line between them. I remember the
          rows being red and the lines being white. You can then type
          text into the rows - 40 columns across and 24 rows down. The
          overall effect was of an on-screen index card. When I first
          used this program back in the eighties I really liked the
          effect and though often about how I could implement
          something similar in Atari BASIC given my skill level at the
          time. I have though about this program a lot over the years,
          facinated it seems by its display, how it could be used, and
          how it could be re-implemented.

          Sometime is 2023, I was delighted when I stumbled upon this
          program again but soon after, a project at work consumed my
          life and did not let up until October 2024. So now that I
          had a little extra time I thought I would play around with
          the program some more. But foolish me did not record were I
          found it. Now obsessed with this program I was in for a big
          dig. I thought it might be on an Antic magazine disk, but
          after searching through 111 disks - no luck. Searching the
          internet was not help. Apparently this program did not have
          much of a following. After almost giving up I found it! It
          was on the second disk for Analog magazone for August 1984,
          Issue 21. The filename was CARDFILE.BAS and the name of the
          program was "ANALOG CARD FILE". The screen colors were
          different - more of a purple with black line but there was
          no doubt it was the program I had been looking for.

          With program in hand I want to see if I can use it develop a
          card file of digital cards. I want to be able to use an
          Atari Emulator to create the cards, but also want a way to
          export them off of emulated disks and on to modern storage.
          The Analog Card File offers two ways of storing the contents
          of a card: it can save them to disk or print them.

          The save feature is slow so I need to wait a few seconds to
          make sure the save is completed. Unfortunately, I think the
          program does a byte for byte copy of the computer screen
          memory to disk. So when I copy the saved file to a modern
          file system it looks like a bunch of random characters, far
          worse then a simple ATASCII to ASCII conversion issue. I
          also confirmed this by using Atari DOS to copy the file to
          the screen and saw the same output. So then to use the saved
          files I would need to create a file converter. This might
          not be too hard to implement - might look into that as a
          "rainy day" project.

          The Atari800MacX emulator that I am using has a printer
          emulation feature. I can use that to print out PDF versions
          of the cards but to get them into text format I have open
          the PDF in Preview then copy the text to a text edit like
          BBEdit and then save the file from that program. It works
          but is slow and manual.













          I'm not sure what I am going to do. I could write the
          converter program, or go with the manual PDF to text
          process, or abandon the program and move on. One other
          option I have is to re-write the program to save the files
          in text format, rather than as a memory dump. Since it is a
          basic program, I have the source code. I also have the
          magazine article for the program as well. What happens next?
          Only time will tell.
